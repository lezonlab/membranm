As an example, the blockfile '2nwl.blk' is provided, along with its 
associated PDB file '2nwl-mem.pdb'.

To view the command-line options of imANM, simply run the program without 
an input file:

$ imanm

To generate a RTB Hessian from the blocks:
$ imanm 2nwl.blk >2nwl.hessian

The program reads the block definitions and the PDB file, calculates
the ANM Hessian in terms of the rigid blocks, and prints it to 
standard output (here redirected to '2nwl.hessian').

The Hessian matrix must then be decomposed.  This can be done with the
provided 'lapdecomp_free' program, which requires the LAPACK and BLAS libraries:
$ lapdecomp 2nwl.hessian 50

The files '2nwl.val' and '2nwl.vec' contain the first 50 eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of the block Hessian.  The block eigenvectors are projected
back into the space of all residues using the 'block2full_free' program provided.
This program needs to know the relationship between the rigid blocks and the
individual nodes of the molecule, and it gets this information from a projection
matrix that maps the block space to the all-residue space.  The projection
matrix '2nwl.prj' is generated with the imANM program with the command:

$ imanm 2nwl.blk -p >2nwl.prj

Now the block eigenvectors can be projected into the space of all residues:
$ block2full_free 2nwl.prj 2nwl.vec >2nwl_full.vec

The eigenvectors in 2nwl_full.vec contain 3582 components, corresponding to 
x-, y- and z-components for each of the 1194 residues.
